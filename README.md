### CORS

This is a Error coming from the browser             
Any time that we are looking at some domain or domain with a port or domain with a subdomain that is different than the URL or the domain that we're trying to make a request to.

Server  provides a very specific set of headers.

So in order to get this error to go away, there's nothing we could do inside of our browser.
There's no additional configuration we could add to our React app or anything like that to make this error go away

On the Back-end Files inside index.js

` const  cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors());`










#TIPS

` const comments = commentsByPostId[req.params.id] || [] //if commentsByPostId[req.params.id] is undefiended return empty array`

#### React

##### useEffect
Use effect can be used to run some code at very specific points in time in the life cycle of a component.
